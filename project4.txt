1.
	a. Increase. Each pixel is calculated then drawn individually. 
		An increase of window size means an increase in amount of pixels to calculate and draw. 
	b. Same. The number of pixels calculated does not change, 
		and the same interactions of light and rays take place if all of the objects are increased in size. 
	c. Increase. More objects in the scene will mean that there are more intersections, shadows, and reflections 
		to calculate. To make the scene look realistic with many objects, a deeper level of recursion 
		is necessary to more accurately depict the rays' interactions with more surfaces. 

2. Reflection and shadows would be better suited for a ray tracer rather an OpenGL, 
	because a ray tracer would be able to take into account the light from reflections and darkness in shadows, 
	while OpenGL renders a primitive in isolation. Transparency could be more easily implemented in OpenGL, 
	by setting an object's alpha level, rather than having to compose each point through calculations.

3. With a regular lattice, we could speed up the ray tracer by first calculating a ray within a cube, 
	instead of the entire scene. Then if the ray does not hit anything, trace it through the next cube. 
	Repeat this until all of cubes with objects have been accessed. 
	By calculating in a smaller space and only calculating the cubes that contain objects, 
	the regular lattice will speed up ray tracing.

4. The current code generates an image under perspective projection, 
	since the rays emit from one point, the origin. To toggle between the two projection modes, 
	you would allow for user input that switches between emitting rays from a certain point for perspective pro
